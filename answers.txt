The linker is responsible for taking all the object code generated by the translator and combining them into a single executable file It resolves references between different parts of the code, like when one function in a file calls another function in a different file linking everything together so the program can work as a whole.

The loader on the other hand takes the executable file created by the linker and loads it into the memory so the CPU can run it It sets up the program in memory handling all the necessary addresses and making sure everything is ready for execution Without the loader the program wouldnt start running on your computer
